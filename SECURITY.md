# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Only the latest release & the tip of main is supported in any way whatsover.
As a single hobbyist doing this on my free time, I do not have the ability to
deal with stable branches.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

Go [here](https://github.com/VorpalBlade/keyboard-backlightd/security/advisories) to
see advisories and report vulnrabilities privately.

Please remember that this is a single-person hobbist project made primarily for the
author's own needs, so everything is done on a best effort basis.
